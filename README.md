The city has built a new building with a height of 45 floors. At the same time there are 3 more underground floors.

There are 4 elevators in the building. 3 elevators are used by all residents of the building. The fourth elevator can be used by everyone - if it is free or only by holders of a special pass.

It is known that the elevator's rate of rise is 1 floor per minute, and the rate of fall is 1 floor in half a minute. The starting floor is 0.

Only 4 people can fit in each elevator. To save money, elevator 1 is available 24 hours, elevator 2 is available 20 hours, elevator 3 is available 15 hours, and elevator 4 is available 24 hours for selected customers and 12 hours for everyone.

Develop a program to calculate how many people and in how much time elevators 1-4 and all elevators together can move. Consider that up to 200 people (or more) may be at the elevators at one time. Take into account that people who have a special card are allowed to pass without queuing
